Included in this repository are files to support candidates applying for software engineering roles through the GSA's US Digital Corps program. 

There are four files in this repository:

1. This README.
1. A `.gitignore` file, that you can ignore.
1. `tester.html`: An HTML file that will run your code.
1. `book_search.js`: A JavaScript source code file that you should edit for your inverview submission.

## Testing your code

You will need to test your code in a browser and see the output in the web developer console. Here is documentation for opening the web developer tools from the Mozilla team for Firefox:

https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/browser_console/index.html#:~:text=You%20can%20open%20the%20Browser,%2B%20J%20on%20a%20Mac

And here are the instructions for Google Chrome:

https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/

Either should work; we tested under both on Mac and Linux.

## Submission

Directions for submission are in the prompt. As a reminder, you should commit your code to a repository called

*firstnamelastname*-usdc-2022

If you were remarkable technologists of years past, you might name your repository

`otisboykin-usdc-2022`

or 

`mariebrown-usdc-2022`

You, of course, should name your repository for the remarkable technologist of civic tech's future that you are.
