# findSearchTermInBooks

Included in this repository are files to support candidates applying for software engineering roles through the US Digital Corps. 

There are two files:

1. `tester.html`: An HTML file that provides context for executing your code.
1. `book_search.js`: A source code file in JavaScript that you should edit for your inverview submission.

## Submission

You will be expected to submit two files, as directed in the prompt. One will be your JavaScript source code, and one is your thought process document. Instructions for how to name and submit your work are in the prompt. 

## Evaluation

We will load your code into an environment that is equivalent to the `tester.html` file.
